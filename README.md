This is a tool for patching pops/cracks in hps files. 

To use:

1.) Place hps files that you want to fix in the 'source' directory

2.) Double click 'hps_patch.bat'

3.) Your patched hps files are in the 'patched' directory (hps files in source remain unmodified)

Source for compiling your own hcshps.exe (must have --fixdecstates option):
